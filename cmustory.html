			I was a high school student who dreamed of becoming a great computer programmer, and Carnegie Mellon University has been my dream school since I started studying in the United States. After a long time, I kept applying to Carnegie Mellon University to fulfill my dream. There were many failures and some small successes. I leave here records of moments of success and failure. I did not give up, and I will not give up.<br/>

			Out of the night that covers me,<br/>
			Black as the Pit from pole to pole,<br/> 
			I thank whatever gods may be<br/>
			For my unconquerable soul.<br/><br/>

			In the fell clutch of circumstance<br/> 
			I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br/>
			Under the bludgeonings of chance<br/>
			My head is bloody, but unbowed.<br/><br/>

			Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br/>   
			Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br/>
			And yet the menace of the years<br/>
			Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.<br/><br/>

			It matters not how strait the gate,<br/>
			How charged with punishments the scroll,<br/>
			I am the master of my fate:<br/>
			I am the captain of my soul.<br/><br/>
